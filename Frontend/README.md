How to launch the client:
0. Run the server with the help of README.md file in that directory
1. Unpack the client files
2. Either open the files using VS Code editor, any other editor with in-built terminal and open the terminal (Ctrl+~ in VS Code) or run CMD at the location of the server files, navigating to the root folder using "cd" command
3. Run "npm install" command. Await completion
4. Run "npm start" command. The client will launch in local testing mode
5. If any errors appear, try running "npm install @mui/material" in the terminal and restarting the client using Ctrl+C and "npm start"

Remark: in this version of the client, many files were edited to ensure that no private school data is leaked. To my best knowledge the client starts and operates well, however errors may occur that I haven't accounted for. The main version of the product which was used during demonstration is working and is hosted on https://findyourclassroom.netlify.app, which can be accessed at any time.
However, as the product is updated by me, this version may contain new features not documented in the IA.
