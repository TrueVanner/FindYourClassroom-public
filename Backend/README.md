How to launch the server:
1. Unpack the server files
2. Either open the files using VS Code editor, any other editor with in-built terminal and open the terminal (Ctrl+~ in VS Code) or run CMD at the location of the server files, navigating to the root folder using "cd" command
3. Run "npm install" command. Await completion
4. Run "npm run build" command. Await completion
5. Run "npm run start" command. The server will launch in local testing mode

Remark: in this version of the server, many files were edited to ensure that no private school data is leaked. To my best knowledge the server starts and operates well, however errors may occur that I haven't accounted for. The main version of the product which was used during demonstration is working and is hosted on https://findyourclassroom.netlify.app, which can be accessed at any time.
However, as the product is updated by me, this version may contain new features not documented in the IA.
