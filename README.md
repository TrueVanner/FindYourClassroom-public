Public version (no personal school information present) of my Computer Science Internal Assessment project completed as a part of IB Diploma Program. Provides assistance to students in finding their current or next class, showing when classes end and which rooms are free during the break. React Typescript & MUI used for frontend, Express.JS used for backend.
Note: this version of the code is not runnable and is meant for demonstration purposes only. Backend and frontend were separately hosted on Azure and Netlify respectively. The final product could be accessed via findyourclassroom.netlify.app, but has been deactivated as of Summer 2023.
